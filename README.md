### Face Detection and Recognition in Python

This project is a comprehensive exploration of face detection and recognition techniques using Python. It leverages powerful libraries like OpenCV, dlib, and Pillow to create applications that can detect faces in images and videos, recognize known faces, predict age and gender, and interpret facial expressionsâ€”all in real-time!

Face Detection from Images: Detect faces in static images and extract them as separate files.

Real-Time Face Detection: Stream video from your webcam and detect faces in real-time.

Dynamic Face Blurring: Automatically blur detected faces in a live video stream.

Facial Expression Recognition: Interpret and display the expressions on detected faces.

Age and Gender Prediction: Estimate the age and gender of individuals using pre-trained deep learning models.

Face Recognition: Identify and recognize known faces from a database.

Face Landmark Manipulation: Access and modify facial landmark points for advanced applications.
